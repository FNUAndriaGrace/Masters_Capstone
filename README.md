# Evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs) for Healthcare Chatbots


## Project Overview

This project focuses on developing an evaluation framework for assessing the performance of LLM-powered healthcare chatbots. With the rise of artificial intelligence (AI) and the increasing use of generative AI models like GPT-4 in healthcare, there is a pressing need for standardized metrics to evaluate chatbots used for healthcare-related tasks such as symptom assessment, patient support, and mental health assistance.

The goal of this research is to design a robust, user-centered evaluation framework that considers accuracy, empathy, trustworthiness, and clinical task effectiveness, ensuring these AI solutions are not only efficient but also safe, ethical, and effective in real-world healthcare applications.

### Key Features

Innovative Evaluation Metrics: The project introduces new metrics to assess the human-centric aspects of healthcare chatbots, including empathy, trust, and personalization.

Comprehensive Framework: The framework provides a holistic approach to evaluating LLM-based healthcare chatbots, considering both technical performance and user experience.

Empirical Validation: The framework will be empirically tested with real-world or simulated healthcare chatbot data to demonstrate its applicability and effectiveness in healthcare contexts.


### Research Objectives
Design and Propose a New Evaluation Framework: A framework for assessing LLM-based chatbots that incorporates both traditional technical metrics and human-centered aspects, such as emotional support and trust-building.

Address Gaps in Existing Metrics: Existing metrics primarily focus on model performance like accuracy but overlook empathy, user trust, and clinical utilityâ€”this project will fill that gap.

Empirical Validation: The framework will be tested with real-world data (e.g., data from mental health chatbots) or simulated case studies to assess its effectiveness and reliability.

### Motivation and Impact
With the increasing reliance on AI in healthcare, particularly in areas like mental health support and patient education, ensuring that chatbots are not only efficient but also safe, personalized, and compassionate is essential. This project aims to:
Enhance patient trust in AI-driven healthcare solutions.
Ensure that healthcare chatbots are empowered with empathy to support vulnerable patients effectively.
Provide a standardized evaluation that could become an industry benchmark for assessing healthcare chatbots.

### Technologies Used
Python: For developing and testing the framework, as well as processing and analyzing data.
Natural Language Processing (NLP): To assess how well chatbots generate human-like responses.
Machine Learning: For evaluating model performance on various healthcare tasks.
Jupyter/ Collab Notebooks: For documenting research, experiments, and results.
Datasets: Use of real-world healthcare data (or simulated datasets) to evaluate the framework.
